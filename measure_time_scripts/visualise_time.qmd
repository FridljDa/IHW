```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
measured_time <- read_csv(here::here("measure_time_scripts/data/measured_time.csv"))

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
# Convert data frame to long format
measured_time <- reshape2::melt(measured_time, 
                                id.vars = c("m","r","ntress"),
                                value.name = "time")

measured_time <- measured_time %>%
  group_by(m, ntress, variable) %>%
  summarise(time = mean(time))
```

```{r}
ggplot(measured_time, aes(x = ntress, y = time, color = variable)) +
  geom_point()
```

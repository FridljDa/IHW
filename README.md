# Independent Hypothesis Weighting

Independent hypothesis weighting (IHW) is a multiple testing procedure that increases power compared to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg by assigning
data-driven weights to each hypothesis. The input to IHW is a two-column
table of p-values and covariates. The covariate can be any continuous-valued
or categorical variable that is thought to be informative on the statistical
properties of each hypothesis test, while it is independent of the p-value
under the null hypothesis. IHW is described in the following paper:

Also see the following paper for the theoretical underpinning of the method:
